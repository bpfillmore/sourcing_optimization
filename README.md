This project is something I've done in my personal time. The goal is creating a reproducible Sourcing Optimization Model - allowing ease of use by encasing everything in a function. 

By defining a function and input files - future users are able to effectively load in all input files, adjust naming convention, and then run the model as a baseline. This allows greater testing and customization, without lift or heavy cost.
